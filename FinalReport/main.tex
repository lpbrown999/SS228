\begin{abstract}
Reinforcement learning (RL) is able to produce effective policies in environments with small discrete state and action spaces but has significant limitations when the state-action space is continuous. Discretization techniques can solve the issue of continuous state-action spaces, however this often results in intractable state spaces or a poor approximation of the continuum.In this paper, we discuss a reinforcement learning strategy for t Super Smash Bros Melee, a video game with a continuous state and action space by applying global approximation in the Q-learning algorithm. We train the algorithm on progressively harder opponents and show improvement in the agents metrics over time.
