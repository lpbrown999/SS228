\section{Problem Statement}

It is infeasible to discretize the state space for this game if we wish the develop a learning algorithm that can be executed in a reasonable amount of time with a standard personal computer. To account for this, we must apply a learning algorithm that can generalize from limited experience. 

\begin{equation}
	Q(s,a) = \Theta_{a}^{T}\beta(s)
\end{equation}
